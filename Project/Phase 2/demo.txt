We changed our dateset in this project, so we re-answered some of the questions in phase 1 to make our project more complete
New dataset URL: https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/seattle?select=listings.csv

Three investigative questions we plan to answer using this datas
1. What is the busiest time of the year for airbnbs in seattle and how much does price change
(i.e. the price range for apartments among off seasons and peak tourist seasons?)
2. Who are the top rating superhosts(or hosts who have served at least ten guests) for each neighbourhood in Seattle?
Which area has the strictest cancellation policy
3. Among the full-score-reviewed listings, what is the percentage of house listings  which has the cost of more than 30 dollars for an extra people?
